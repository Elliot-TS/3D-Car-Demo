The scene consists of a car model loaded from a json file and a ground plane.  The car and the ground plane both have color textures, and the ground plane also has a normal texture which can be toggled off or on with the space bar.  The car can be driven with the WASD keys, and the steering is physically accurate for a car driving on a flat surface: each wheel rotates independently based on how far each wheel individually has moved, and both front wheels steer at slightly different angles to reduce slippage.  The camera follows the car and always faces it.  The view can be adjusted by orbiting around the car with the mouse.  Four types of lights were implemented: an environmental light, a dim blue directional light, a red point light, and two spotlights that are the car's headlights.  There's also an environment texture in the background.  Everything was implemented using WebGL using Kotlin/JS.
