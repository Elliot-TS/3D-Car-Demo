The scene consists of a car model loaded from a json file and a ground plane.  The car and the ground plane both have color textures, and the ground plane also has a normal texture which can be toggled off or on with the space bar.  The car can be driven with the WASD keys, and the steering is physically accurate for a car driving on a flat surface: each wheel rotates independently based on how far each wheel individually has moved, and the inside front wheel steers more steeply than the outside front wheel so that they are both angled tangental to their path of motion.  The camera follows the car and always faces it.  The view can be adjusted by orbiting around the car with the mouse.  Four types of lights were implemented: an environmental light, a dim blue directional light, a red point light, and two spotlights that are the car's headlights.  There's also an environment texture in the background.  Everything was implemented using WebGL using Kotlin/JS.

When the car is steering, the inside wheels move along a sharper circular path than the outside wheels.  As a result, the inside front wheel must be set at a steeper angle than the outside front wheel in order for both wheels to be angled tangental to their path of motion.
